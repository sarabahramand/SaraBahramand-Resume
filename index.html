        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am Sara and I specialize in psychology. I am currently a student who is both pre-med and pursuing psychology, and I also have work experience and skills on top of that. Because of my studies, I am especially good at science and psychology, but I also have a lot of interests outside of that, such as art, writing, and technology. I find myself to be exceptional at all of these. Therefore, I am competent in a wide variety of skills that would certainly be useful in many job environments. Furthermore, I am known to always be a punctual person who arrives early, has great communication skills, and works professionally and productively in every job.
<br><br>

        At the age of 17, I started working with a job in retail–specifically Kohl’s–as a sales associate. I worked both the cash register and the sales floor to help customers find items, organize the products, and change fitting rooms. Additionally, I answered phone calls and covered approximately ⅓ of the store at a time by myself. Within these shifts, I was consistently running around the store and working in a fast paced environment–all while still maintaining a smile on my face and great hospitality towards customers. I was constantly complimented for my exceptional customer service skills, time management, and hard work. Even then, it was only my first job and I only worked there for a short amount of time as a summer job before swiftly moving onto my current job when I entered college. At this time, I had barely turned 18 and was freshly new into university. I worked (and still do work) as a library circulation worker. At this job, I manage the front desk at the university library and help the staff around the library when they need tasks done. Once again, the main focus is customer service and good hospitality, which I am exceptionally good at. I am known for being good at communication, punctual at my job, and dependable to rely on for specialized tasks such as graphic design. <br><br>

        I am an aspiring psychiatrist who enjoys connecting the dots: be it ideas from different disciplines, people from different teams, or applications from different industries. I have strong communication skills and an academic background in science, statistics, and psychology.My passion lies in solving mental problems with tailored problem solving and communicating complex ideas to patients who are searching to get better. I am able to jump across verticals to deliver high-performing techniques.In my undergraduate studies, I’ve taken on various leadership roles, including tutoring those who need help in the field, coordinating institute-wide research events for hundreds of people, and participating in clubs. I'm graduating in June 2025 and I'm interested in full-time psychiatry or medical roles. I'm interested in an entry-level position in an office, psychology, or medical position in Riverside in Southern California alongside my studies. I would also be interested in an internship. I am certain that I would be a great fit in a number of different positions; please feel free to reach out to me!
